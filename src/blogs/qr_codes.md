### Restaurants

Even before the outbreak of COVID-19, you might have seen a QR code at a table or posted to the wall, enabling any customer to quickly scan the code with their phone and access the establishment's menu. When COVID happened, we saw this practice explode. Instead of having to trust that employees have properly sanitized paper menus, it is now almost ubiquitous that restaurant and bar patrons can access the full menu using their phones. This provides obvious convenience and safety improvements in a time where we all have to be careful of public spaces where people gather indoors. Although it does have its problems (I'm someone who can't stand seeing that I've downloaded the menu pdf 3 times already to my phone under a filename I would never remember or think to look for), the advantages are clear. While I do worry about technology being used for EVERYTHING without careful consideration, scanning menus is one use that I am totally on board for.
